# PROBLEM STATEMENT:

The Blockchain transactions involve the transfer of assets, execution of smart contracts, or interaction with decentralized applications (dApps). These transactions require computational resources, which are provided by network validators (miners or stakers). To compensate for these resources, users must pay GAS feesâ€”a fundamental cost associated with executing operations on blockchain networks like Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), or Polygon

# WHAT WE ARE PROVIDING?
Oregano is a plaftform where it helps users with thier crypto transactions by "gasless transaction via meta-transaction" refers to a method where a user can execute a blockchain transaction without directly paying the associated gas fees, as a third party called a "relayer" covers the cost on their behalf, essentially making the transaction appear "gasless" to the user; this is achieved through a special type of transaction structure known as a "meta-transaction" which allows the relayer to submit the transaction on the user's behalf. The main benefit is a smoother user experience, especially for new users who might not be familiar with managing gas fees on a blockchain. So, if users using third parties as Relayer to pay thier GAS fees then who payes the GAS fees ? Relayer role: A relayer is a dedicated service that receives a signed transaction request from the user, pays the gas fee, and submits the transaction to the blockchain on their behalf. How it works: The user initiates a transaction within a dApp, signing a message containing the transaction details. This signed message is sent to the relayer. The relayer verifies the signature and submits the transaction to the blockchain, paying the gas fees. The signature is formed for the target contract and the data of the desired transaction, using the user's private key. This signing happens off-chain and costs no gas. The signature is passed to the Relayer so it can execute the transaction for the user (and pay the gas). On-Top the Relayer"s get paid by charging a fee on top of the gas costs they cover when executing a user's transaction on the blockchain; essentially, the user pays the relayer a small fee for taking on the responsibility of paying the gas fees for their transaction, allowing for a "gasless" experience for the user.

# EXPERIENCE:

By leveraging meta-transactions, users can interact with decentralized applications (dApps) without needing native blockchain tokens to cover transaction costs. This innovation is particularly beneficial for onboarding new users who may find GAS fees complex and restrictive. It enhances the usability of DeFi, NFTs, and gaming applications by allowing developers to sponsor fees or use alternative payment mechanisms. Additionally, businesses and enterprises can adopt blockchain more easily, as gasless transactions remove a major barrier to entry. By improving transaction efficiency, reducing friction, and enabling smoother adoption, gasless transactions contribute to a more inclusive and scalable Web3 ecosystem, making blockchain technology truly accessible to a global audience.
